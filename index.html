                PROLOGUE </br>
                I am the Shade.
                Through the dolent city, I flee.
                Through the eternal woe, I take flight.
                Along the banks of the river Arno, I scramble, breathless … turning left onto Via dei
                Castellani, making my way northward, huddling in the shadows of the Uffizi.
                And still they pursue me.
                Their footsteps grow louder now as they hunt with relentless determination.
                For years they have pursued me. Their persistence has kept me underground … forced
                me to live in purgatory … laboring beneath the earth like a chthonic monster.
                I am the Shade.
                Here aboveground, I raise my eyes to the north, but I am unable to 􀉹nd a direct path
                to salvation … for the Apennine Mountains are blotting out the first light of dawn.
                I pass behind the palazzo with its crenellated tower and one-handed clock … snaking
                through the early-morning vendors in Piazza di San Firenze with their hoarse voices
                smelling of lampredotto and roasted olives. Crossing before the Bargello, I cut west
                toward the spire of the Badia and come up hard against the iron gate at the base of the
                stairs.
                Here all hesitation must be left behind.
                I turn the handle and step into the passage from which I know there will be no return.
                I urge my leaden legs up the narrow staircase … spiraling skyward on soft marble
                treads, pitted and worn.
                The voices echo from below. Beseeching.
                They are behind me, unyielding, closing in.
                They do not understand what is coming … nor what I have done for them!
                Ungrateful land!
                As I climb, the visions come hard … the lustful bodies writhing in 􀉹ery rain, the
                gluttonous souls 􀉻oating in excrement, the treacherous villains frozen in Satan’s icy
                grasp.
                I climb the 􀉹nal stairs and arrive at the top, staggering near dead into the damp
                morning air. I rush to the head-high wall, peering through the slits. Far below is the
                blessed city that I have made my sanctuary from those who exiled me.
                The voices call out, arriving close behind me. “What you’ve done is madness!”
                Madness breeds madness.
                “For the love of God,” they shout, “tell us where you’ve hidden it!”
                For precisely the love of God, I will not.
                I stand now, cornered, my back to the cold stone. They stare deep into my clear green
                eyes, and their expressions darken, no longer cajoling, but threatening. “You know we
                have our methods. We can force you to tell us where it is.”
                For that reason, I have climbed halfway to heaven.
                Without warning, I turn and reach up, curling my 􀉹ngers onto the high ledge, pulling
                myself up, scrambling onto my knees, then standing … unsteady at the precipice. Guide
                me, dear Virgil, across the void.
                They rush forward in disbelief, wanting to grab at my feet, but fearing they will upset
                my balance and knock me o􀊃. They beg now, in quiet desperation, but I have turned my
                back. I know what I must do.
                Beneath me, dizzyingly far beneath me, the red tile roofs spread out like a sea of 􀉹re
                on the countryside, illuminating the fair land upon which giants once roamed … Giotto,
                Donatello, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Botticelli.
                I inch my toes to the edge.
                “Come down!” they shout. “It’s not too late!”
                O, willful ignorants! Do you not see the future? Do you not grasp the splendor of my
                creation? The necessity?
                I will gladly make this ultimate sacri􀉹ce … and with it I will extinguish your 􀉹nal
                hope of finding what you seek.
                You will never locate it in time.
                Hundreds of feet below, the cobblestone piazza beckons like a tranquil oasis. How I
                long for more time … but time is the one commodity even my vast fortunes cannot
                afford.
                In these final seconds, I gaze down at the piazza, and I behold a sight that startles me.
                I see your face.
                You are gazing up at me from the shadows. Your eyes are mournful, and yet in them I
                sense a veneration for what I have accomplished. You understand I have no choice. For
                the love of Mankind, I must protect my masterpiece.
                It grows even now … waiting … simmering beneath the bloodred waters of the lagoon that
                reflects no stars.
                And so, I lift my eyes from yours and I contemplate the horizon. High above this
                burdened world, I make my final supplication.
                Dearest God, I pray the world remembers my name not as a monstrous sinner, but as the
                glorious savior you know I truly am. I pray Mankind will understand the gift I leave behind.
                My gift is the future.
                My gift is salvation.
                My gift is Inferno.
                With that, I whisper my amen … and take my final step, into the abyss.
                CHAPTER 1
                The memories materialized slowly … like bubbles surfacing from the darkness of a
                bottomless well.
                A veiled woman.
                Robert Langdon gazed at her across a river whose churning waters ran red with blood.
                On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her face hidden by a
                shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue tainia cloth, which she now raised in honor of the
                sea of corpses at her feet. The smell of death hung everywhere.
                Seek, the woman whispered. And ye shall find.
                Langdon heard the words as if she had spoken them inside his head. “Who are you?”
                he called out, but his voice made no sound.
                Time grows short, she whispered. Seek and find.
                Langdon took a step toward the river, but he could see the waters were bloodred and
                too deep to traverse. When Langdon raised his eyes again to the veiled woman, the
                bodies at her feet had multiplied. There were hundreds of them now, maybe thousands,
                some still alive, writhing in agony, dying unthinkable deaths … consumed by 􀉹re, buried
                in feces, devouring one another. He could hear the mournful cries of human su􀊃ering
                echoing across the water.
                The woman moved toward him, holding out her slender hands, as if beckoning for
                help.
                “Who are you?!” Langdon again shouted.
                In response, the woman reached up and slowly lifted the veil from her face. She was
                strikingly beautiful, and yet older than Langdon had imagined—in her sixties perhaps,
                stately and strong, like a timeless statue. She had a sternly set jaw, deep soulful eyes,
                and long, silver-gray hair that cascaded over her shoulders in ringlets. An amulet of
                lapis lazuli hung around her neck—a single snake coiled around a staff.
                Langdon sensed he knew her … trusted her. But how? Why?
                She pointed now to a writhing pair of legs, which protruded upside down from the
                earth, apparently belonging to some poor soul who had been buried head􀉹rst to his
                waist. The man’s pale thigh bore a single letter—written in mud—R.
                R? Langdon thought, uncertain. As in … Robert? “Is that … me?”
                The woman’s face revealed nothing. Seek and find, she repeated.
                Without warning, she began radiating a white light … brighter and brighter. Her
                entire body started vibrating intensely, and then, in a rush of thunder, she exploded into
                a thousand splintering shards of light.
                Langdon bolted awake, shouting.
                The room was bright. He was alone. The sharp smell of medicinal alcohol hung in the
                air, and somewhere a machine pinged in quiet rhythm with his heart. Langdon tried to</p>
